## How to Use This Website
1. Admin: Create Doctor Schedules
Log in with an admin account to open up appointment slots for patients.

Access the Admin Dashboard.

Navigate to Doctor Schedules.

Click Add New Schedule and specify:

Doctor name

Date & time range

Maximum patients per slot

Save the schedule. Once saved, those slots become available for patient booking.

2. Patient: Book an Appointment
After an admin has published schedules, switch to a patient role to reserve a slot.

Log out of the admin account.

Log in with a patient account.

Go to Book Appointment.

Select your preferred doctor and available time slot.

Fill in any required details and confirm.

3. Test Credentials
Use these accounts to try out both roles without creating new users:

Role	Email	Password
Admin	admin@test.com	Admin@123
User	patient@test.com	Patient@123
4. Scheduling Notes
All schedules and appointments are time-sensitive. Slots in the past will automatically expire.

If you see no available slots, double-check that the admin has created future schedules.

To avoid “no slots available” errors, keep your system clock accurate and work with dates at least one hour ahead.
