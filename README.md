## How to Use This Website
Because my project works with schedules 
1. Admin: Create Doctor Schedules, meaning that when time passes, doctor schedules and patient appoinment will be out of date. To make an appointment, please follow the instructions below
Log in with an admin account to open up appointment slots for patients.

Access the Admin Dashboard.

Navigate to Doctor Schedules.

Click Add New Schedule and specify:

Doctor name

Date & time range

Maximum patients per slot

Save the schedule. Once saved, those slots become available for patient booking.

2. Patient: Book an Appointment
After an admin has published schedules, switch to a patient role to reserve a slot.

Log out of the admin account.

Log in with a patient account.

Go to Book Appointment.

Select your preferred doctor and available time slot.

Fill in any required details and confirm.
